#Task 3a Marco Polo
'''
Task 3 Phone charger (4marks)

Write a program that ask the user what percentage of battery power their 
mobile phone has. If the charge remaining is 5% or less, print out Connect 
your charger! For example:
=========================
Remaining charge: 3
Connect your charger!
========================= 
If the charge remaining is more than 5%, the program should do nothing:
=========================
Remaining charge: 50
All good.
=========================
